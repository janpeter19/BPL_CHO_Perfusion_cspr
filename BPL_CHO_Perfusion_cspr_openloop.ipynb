    "# BPL CHO Perfusion cspr openloop - demo\n",
    "This notebook is about CHO perfusion cultivation and focus on the concept of Cell \n",
    "Specific Perfusion Rate (CSPR).  Recombinant protein production is included in the model but not \n",
    "shown in the diagrams here.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model used here was orignally developed and validated for fed-batch cultivation of CHO cultures [1], \n",
    "but also got some influence from perfusion cultivation [2]. The model emphasize the bottlenecks of metabolism \n",
    "and growth and inspired from similar models of microbial cultures. One interesting aspect is that the model \n",
    "brings a theoretical base for the usefulness of the CSPR concept often used experimentally [4] and [5]. \n",
    "The results of simulation shown here are in accordance with experiments in a qualititative way, \n",
    "howerver not tested more quantitatively, to the authors knowledge. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main result is that when the perfusion rate should be increased from one set-point to another, \n",
    "it should be changed slowly. An abrupt step-wise increase should be avoided. A slow increase in \n",
    "the pefusion rate minimize the risk of unnecessary by-product formation of lactate and amonia and \n",
    "make the culture increase in cell concentration quicker to a new steady-state compared to a step-wise \n",
    "perfusion rate change. The rate of change of perfusion rate should not exceed the maximal culture growth rate. \n",
    "\n",
    "The strategy to limit rate of change of perfusion rate is much more important for mammalian cultures \n",
    "than for microbial cultures. The reason is that mammalian cell cutures increase in cell density after \n",
    "an inrease in perfusion rate, while mibrobial cultures remains constant in cell density.  This difference \n",
    "is most likely due to the fact that maintenance metabolism is a larger part in mammalian cultures and \n",
    "at higher growth rates the percentage of maintenance becomes smaller and the overall yield increase, \n",
    "while microbial cultures has a much more contsant yield over a broad range of growth rates. \n",
    "These ideas are discussed in section 2.2 in [3], together with other insights into perfusion cultivation \n",
    "obtained from simulation studies of the current model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once again, it would be good to compare simulations with relevant experimental data from perfusion cultivation. \n",
    "Hopefully, the material presented here can stimulate work in this direction."
